			<b>Taiji (Taichi,太极)</b> is a long-term project about formal specification and verification of operating systems (OS). The figure of Taiji (<img src="images/taiji.jpg" width="30" alt="Symbol of Taiji in China" />) in China is the composition of OS ("O" and "S"). 
			The OS is a fundamental component of critical systems. Correctness and reliability of systems highly depend on the system’s underlying OS. From the recent researches in the world, we could see that formal methods is a promising way to the high assurance of OSs for security/safety critical domains. Two significant projects are <a href="https://ts.data61.csiro.au/projects/seL4/" target="_blank"><b>seL4</b></a> and <a href="https://www.cs.yale.edu/flint/certikos/" target="_blank"><b>CertiKOS</b></a>. 
			</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13pt;">
			In the Taiji project, we are developing theories, approaches, tools and applications for formal specification and proofs of OSs considering the high evaluation level of safety/security certification (DO-178 B/C, Common Criteria, etc.). 
			</p>
			
			<p style="font-size:13pt;">
			We have developed a full formal specification for ARINC 653 which is the de-facto standard for partitioning operating system in aerospace and avionics. We found >= 10 safety/security bugs in the standard, which are adopted by the standard commitee. 
			We have developed rely-guarantee-based compositional approach and its implementation in Isabelle/HOL, the CSimpl and PiCore tools, in particular for the verification of concurrent OS kernels. Furthermore, we have formally verified core modules of many OSs, including <a href="https://www.zephyrproject.org" target="_blank"><strong>Zephyr RTOS</strong></a> from the Linux Foundation for IoT , VxWorks 653, <a href="https://pok-kernel.github.io" target="_blank"><b>POK</b></a> partitioning OS, <a href="https://fentiss.com/products/hypervisor/" target="_blank"><b>XtratuM</b></a> embedded hypervisor, and many RTOSs in China deployed in domains of aerospace, avionics, IoT, AI, etc.

						Formal methods are mandated by the security/safety certification of OS separation kernels and have been carried out since this concept emerged.

						We published the most comprehensive survey on formal methods application for OS separation kernels, which is the state of the art survey in this research field from the last survey by Gerwin Klein in 2009.

						<b> Formal Verification of Zephyr RTOS from Linux Foundation </b>
						</a></br>
			
						<span class="panel-content margin10 fg-dark nlp nrp">
						<p>
						RTOS are frequently deployed on critical systems, making formal verification of RTOS necessary to ensure their reliability. One of the state of the art RTOS is Zephyr RTOS, a Linux Foundation project. Zephyr is an open source RTOS for connected, resource-constrained devices, and built with security and safety design in mind.The Zephyr community is also considering high assurance level of safety/security certification (Common Criteria, DO-178C). We are developing formal specification and proof of Zephyr compliant with the EAL 7, highest level of Common Criteria security certification. 
						</p>
						<p>
						<b>Correctness, Safety and Security of Zephyr memory management</b>: The first module verified in Zephyr is its memory management. 
						This work is the first formal specification and mechanized proof of a concurrent memory allocation for a real-world OS concerning a comprehensive set of properties. 
						An incorrect specification and implementation of the memory management may lead to system crashes or exploitable attacks. For the highest assurance evaluation level, we develop a fine-grained formal specification of the buddy memory management in Zephyr RTOS, which closely follows the C code easing validation of the specification and the source code. The rely-guarantee-based compositional verification has been enforced with respect to a comprehensive set of critical properties, including functional correctness, safety and security. To support formal verification of the security property, we extend our rely-guarantee framework PiCore by a compositional reasoning approach for integrity. During the formal verification, we found three bugs in the C code of Zephyr.

						<b>Information-flow Security and Proof of OS Separation Kernels </b>
						</a></br>
			
						<span class="panel-content margin10 fg-dark nlp nrp">
						<p>
						Assurance of information-flow security by formal methods is mandated in security certification of OS separation kernels. 
						Based on the information-flow security model in our <a href="corin.html">CORIN project</a>, we developed a specification development and security analysis method in Isabelle/HOL for separation kernels based on refinement. Two levels of functional specification are developed by the refinement. A major part of separation kernel requirements in ARINC 653 are modeled, such as kernel initialization, two-level scheduling, partition and process management, and inter-partition communication. The formal specification and its security proofs are carried out in the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover. We have reviewed the source code of one industrial and two open-source ARINC SK implementations, i.e. VxWorks 653, XtratuM, and POK, in accordance with the formal specification. During the verification and code review, 6 security flaws, which can cause information leakage, are found in the ARINC 653 standard and the implementations.

						<b>Formal Specification and Verification of ARINC 653 Standard and Partitioning OSs </b>
						</a></br>
			
						<span class="panel-content margin10 fg-dark nlp nrp">
						<p>
						Partitioning operating systems (POSs) have been widely applied in safety-critical domains from aerospace to automotive. In order to improve the safety and the certification process of POSs, the ARINC 653 standard has been developed and complied with by the mainstream POSs (VxWorks, INTEGRITY-178B, DDC-I Deos, PikeOS, and open source Matrix653, XtratuM, POK). For the purpose of DO-178C Level A certification, we have developed formal specifications of ARINC 653 P1-3 (monocore) and P1-4 (multicore) compliant with Level A requirements. We have formally verified a comprehensive set of critical properties (safety and information-flow security) on the specification and ARINC 653 implementations.  During the formal verification, more than 10 errors were found in the ARINC 653 standard and operating systems. 
						</p>
						
						<p>
						In papers [1] and [2], we developed a comprehensive formal specification for ARINC 653 P1-3 using Event-B and enforced automatic formal verification of correctness and safety. In [3] and [4], we developed a CC EAL 7 compliant formal framework for specification development and carried out formal verification of information-flow security. We are now developing a formal specification of the full ARINC 653 standard for operating systems (ARINC653 P1-4, multicore) in CSimpl. First release is the partition management and inter-partition communication in [5].

						<b> CC EAL7 compliant Formal Specification of Linux Security Modules (LSM) </b>
						</a></br>
			
						<span class="panel-content margin10 fg-dark nlp nrp">
						<p>
						The <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/security/index.html" target="_blank">Linux Security Module (LSM)</a> is a general access control framework for Linux kernel. It enables various security models to be performed as a loadable kernel module. However, certified high assurance of LSM by formal methods is challenging due to its dynamic policies and high-level abstraction of interfaces for various implementations. Therefore, the efforts of providing a standardized formal specification and security analysis concerning LSM, as well as security proofs, are notable for the development and certification of LSM for the Linux community, which can be used to formulate a provably reliable, secure, and efficient Linux security mechanism.
						</p>
						<p>
						We have proposed a novel and formal framework (VeriLSM) in Isabelle/HOL for certifying and implementing high-assurance LSM modules. VeriLSM is parameterized, standardized and reusable for formal verification and certification of concrete LSM modules. It is comprised of a dynamic security policy model interpreting access control by noninterference, and a parameterized formal specification of LSM which specifies LSM hook interfaces, LSM model and an abstract execution of Linux kernel APIs. The specification and proof of VeriLSM are reusable for LSM implementations, e.g. Smack, AppArmor and SELinux. For the purpose of high assurance certification, we develop the design-level specification of Smack and integrate it with the VeriLSM framework, and thus develop the formal artifacts completely compliant with the formal methods requirements of the highest assurance level (EAL 7) in Common Criteria (CC).

						Memory management is the most complex module in OSs since its complicated data structures and algorithms. An incorrect specification and implementation of the memory management may lead to system crashes or exploitable attacks. In order to provide reusable formal specification of memory allocation algorithms and implementations, we are developing various memory management implementations in Isabelle/HOL.
