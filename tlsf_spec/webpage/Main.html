<h2>A Verified Specification of TLSF Memory Management Allocator using State Monads</h2>

<div class="sessions">

<p> Developed in Isabelle/HOL 2018 </p>
<p> For your convenience, you could browse the sources in web browsers as below. </p>

<h3> Basic Infrastructure and Configuration </h3>
<p>
The TLSF memory management allocator runs on different operating systems and its performance is closely related to the system configurations. In our model, we parameterize the system configuration and propose several constraints to keep it flexible but not arbitrarily defined.
</p>
<p>
Basic data structure includes the definition of blocks and the memory state. We also define auxilary functions to manipulate the blocks in the state.

<h3> Segregated List </h3>
<p>
Segregated lists, together with the associated bitmaps, play an important role in the TLSF algorithm. In TLSF algorithm, free blocks are organized in segregated lists and each segregated list only contains the free blocks within a specific size interval.
Moreover, segregated lists have a two-level structure. The first level splits sizes in power of 2 ranges, e.g. [32,63],[64,127],[128,255],etc. The second level sub-divides each first level range linearly, e.g. [64,71],[72,79],[80,87],etc. The two-level structure composes a free list matrix where each element is a list of free blocks within a specific size interval and the size interval is related to the matrix indices. In Isabelle/HOL, we model the two-level segregated list structure and proved several important properties of the structure.

<h3> Function Definition using State Monad </h3>
<p>
Function mapping_insert, mapping_search and find_suitable_block are useful for allocating and deallocating memory blocks. They are defined in functional programming style in Isabelle/HOL and their correctness has been verified.
</p>
<p>
State monads allow pure functional model of computation with side effects and it is convenient to express computation nondeterministically in our abstract model. So we use the nondeterministic state monad in Isabelle/HOL library to define function malloc and free. The abstract model captures all the computational behavior with respect to the design of TLSF algorithm.

<h3> Invariants and Specification </h3>
<p>
At this level, we consider the memory management as a component in the entire operating system model and the interaction between other modules and memory management should depend on the abstraction instead of concrete implemen- tation. Because interruption is not concerned in our model, the execution of programs can be interpreted as the transition between states. The abstraction mainly concerns the state flow, including invariants and pre- and post-conditions.
