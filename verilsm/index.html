<h3> Linux Security Modules</h3>
The Linux kernel has adopted the Linux Security Module (version 2.6). It is a lightweight general access control framework for the Linux kernel. It has supported a general framework that provided a set of security hooks to control operations on kernel objects and a set of opaque security fields in kernel data structures for maintaining security attributes. This framework could then be used by loadable kernel modules to implement any desired model of security. The generality of LSM allows enhanced access controls to be effectively implemented without kernel patches. Several independent modules have been developed for the LSM framework, such as Security-Enhanced Linux, Smack TOMOYO and AppArmor.
<h3>Common Criteria</h3>
<p> The Common Criteria(CC) are a standard for security evaluations that are mutually recognized by a large number of countries. There are seven levels of assurance (EAL 1-7) in the standard and a number of so-called protection profiles that detail what exactly is being certified and for which application area.  The following chain of requirements of evaluation assurance level 7: (1) a formal security model (SPM), (2) a formal functional specification of security functions (FSP), and (3) a TOE design (TDS). A formal modeling of the system and a formal analysis are required on its highest evaluation assurance level. The highest assurance level of CC certification (EAL7) requires comprehensive security analysis using formal representations of the security model and functional specification as well as formal proofs of correspondence between them.</p>
<h3>VeriLSM Framework </h3>
<p>
We propose a novel and formal framework (VeriLSM) for certifying and implementing high-assurance LSM modules.  VeriLSM is parameterized, standardized and reusable for formal verification and certification of concrete LSM modules. The specification development and security analysis method using stepwise refinement for Linux LSM with regard to the CC EAL 7 certification.  
The SPM of VeriLSM represents the security policies for LSM and is a formal model. It is a dynamic security policy model interpreting access control by noninterference.  We use information-flow security properties to interpret the access control policies of LSM. FSP is comprised of a parameterized formal specification of LSM which specifies LSM hook interfaces, LSM model and an abstract execution of Linux kernel APIs.   We develop the design level specification of Smack (TDS)  and integrate it with the VeriLSM framework. Moreover, the specifications and proofs of VeriLSM are reusable for LSM implementations, e.g. Smack, AppArmor, and SELinux.
