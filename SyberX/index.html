<h3>SyberX</h3>
SyberX is a microkernel operating system that supports different types of virtual machines (VM) such as bare-metal applications, Linux, real-time operating system (RTOS), robot operating system (ROS), automotive control system, etc. It is mainly used in the mixed-criticality system, which allows applications of different criticality levels, such as real-time control, AI computing, human-computer interaction, etc., to coexist and interact on the same hardware platform.

The architecture of SyberX is shown in Fig. 1 including the core layer, service layer, VM control layer, security control layer, and interface layer.

<h3>Common Criteria</h3>
<p> The Common Criteria(CC) are a standard for security evaluations that are mutually recognized by a large number of countries. There are seven levels of assurance (EAL 1-7) in the standard and a number of so-called protection profiles that detail what exactly is being certified and for which application area.  The following chain of requirements of evaluation assurance level 7: (1) a formal security model (SPM), (2) a formal functional specification of security functions (FSP), and (3) a TOE design (TDS). A formal modeling of the system and a formal analysis are required on its highest evaluation assurance level. The highest assurance level of CC certification (EAL7) requires comprehensive security analysis using formal representations of the security model and functional specification as well as formal proofs of correspondence between them.</p>
<h3>Methodology in Isabelle/HOL</h3>
<p>
The goal of this research is not just to formally verify the security and functionalcorrectness of a particular SyberX implementation, but rather to find the best design
and development methodologies for SyberX that can be used to build provably reliable, secure, and efficient SyberX. 

In this paper, we discuss some experiences of applying formal methods with regard to the EAL 7 of CC certification. We present an extensible architecture for building
high-assurance SyberX. Certainly, we also present a realistic case study of the SyberX kernel to illustrate the application of our methodology. The goal of our works is to an
ongoing evaluation for SyberX under the Common Criteria (CC) to a high evaluation assurance level (EAL5+) with + addressing the formal models for up to EAL7.
